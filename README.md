#Makers Academy week 1: Boris Bikes Challenge 

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. For a small fee, anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London. Bikes are located at Docking Stations dotted throughout the city.

Setup
--------
This project was completed using TDD and pairing. The daily changing pair programming nature of Maker's means that the project code base can change on a daily basis. Therefore, there are seperate (often ophan) branches for each session and these have not been merged due to differences in approach. 

The project
-----------

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer. Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality. They call it - guess what? - 'Boris' Bikes, and they're offering a tasty sum of money.
